# API Services Downtime Update: March 25, 2025

We want to inform all our users about the recent downtime affecting our API services and provide important updates on the current status and next steps.

## üì¢ Service Status Update

Our stable and beta API services have been down for the last four days (since March 21, 2025) due to unforeseen circumstances. This interruption was caused by the banning of our main Telegram group for reasons beyond our control.

### Current Status:

- **Stable API Services**: Currently down, expected to be resolved in the next 2-3 days
- **Beta API Services**: Will be live from March 25, 2025, 10 AM IST
- **Paid API Tier**: Remains fully operational and unaffected by the current issues

## üîÑ New Communication Channels

Due to the unexpected ban of our main Telegram group, we have established new communication channels:

### üì± New Telegram Channel

We've created a new official channel for all announcements:
- **Channel Link**: [https://t.me/devsdocode](https://t.me/devsdocode)
- **Content**: All API service announcements and YouTube content updates
- **Discussion Group**: A discussion group is attached to the channel for community interaction and support

We encourage all users to join this new channel to stay updated on service status and receive important announcements.

## üîë Creating Beta API Keys

With the beta API services coming back online today, we've made some important changes to the API key creation process:

### How to Get Your Beta API Key:

1. **Click the "Join Beta Program" floating button** visible on this page
2. **Authentication Required**:
   - If already logged in with your Google account, you'll see the beta API key creation options
   - If not logged in, you'll be prompted to log in first before proceeding
3. **Create Your Key**:
   - Choose a name for your API key
   - Click the "Create API Key" button
   - The system will generate a partial API key in this format: `beta-ddc-abcdefghij-xxx`
     - Where `abcdefghij` represents the first ten characters of your API key
     - And `xxx` represents the remaining forty-eight characters (not shown for security)

### Completing Your API Key:

To obtain your complete API key:
1. Click the option provided below the API key card to "Go to Telegram Bot"
2. You'll be automatically redirected to our Telegram bot
3. The bot will automatically receive the start command
4. The bot will provide you with your complete API key

### Troubleshooting:

If you encounter any errors during API key creation, please check for these common issues:
- You may have already created a beta API key (only one per account is allowed)
- The server or bot may be temporarily down
- Connection issues between our service and Telegram

Under normal circumstances, the API key creation process should work smoothly.

## ü§ñ Available Models

To check the list of available models in the beta API tier, please visit:
- [sree.shop/models](https://sree.shop/models)

Note that the paid API tier operates independently from the beta tier and continues to provide all previously available models without interruption.

## üíº Paid API Option

If you require a more stable experience during this transition period, we recommend shifting to our paid API tier, which has remained unaffected by the current issues.
