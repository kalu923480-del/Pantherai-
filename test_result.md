# OpenRouter Clone Project

## Project Description
Building a complete OpenRouter clone - a unified API gateway that aggregates and routes requests to multiple AI models using 10 provided API keys. The system functions as a meta-API that allows users to access various models (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, etc.) through a single endpoint.

## User Requirements
1. ✅ Unified Meta-API Key system
2. ✅ Model routing with automatic detection
3. ✅ OpenRouter-like JSON schema
4. ✅ Pricing management and visibility
5. ✅ Load balancing + failover
6. ✅ Admin dashboard for usage tracking
7. ✅ Rate limit management
8. ✅ Security via API keys
9. ✅ Required endpoints: /v1/chat/completions, /v1/models, /v1/status

## API Keys Provided
- 10 API keys in format "ddc-a4f-[unique_id]"
- Need to implement dynamic model detection per key
- Failover system for rate limits/errors

## Tech Stack
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Frontend: React
- Database: MongoDB
- Architecture: API Gateway pattern

## Development Progress
- [x] Project initialization
- [x] Requirements analysis
- [ ] Backend API development
- [ ] Frontend interface
- [ ] Testing and integration

## Testing Protocol
- Backend testing using deep_testing_backend_v2
- Frontend testing using auto_frontend_testing_agent
- Full integration testing

## Incorporate User Feedback
- User provided specific API keys and detailed requirements
- Need to build functional system that can route real requests
- Focus on OpenRouter compatibility and feature parity
